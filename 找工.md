I want to be a software developer because designing computer programs lets me use my creative and problem-solving skills and it brings me personal satisfaction to see my codes working. I've become intimately familiar with several coding languages, participated in coding challenges, and worked on personal coding projects. I'm excited to begin a career as a software developer and learn more this line of work from industry professionals.
