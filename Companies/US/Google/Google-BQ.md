could you tell me more about the self-development opportunities that google provides: technical and non-technical?

- intro to technical writing

three skills that you think are most critical to success in your role at Google?

1. ask for help and be open
2. express your idea in any way you fell comfortable with
3. find your group, find allies with same interests or share the same value to find support and inclusive

what was something that surprised you about Google:

1. scale
2. google code search
3. how easy to reach anyone

how did you prepare for your interviews

1. leedcode
2. youtube video into different categories
3. mock interviews to get feedback
4. Communication!!!

common mistakes you see candidates make during the interviews

1. communication is key
2. not stick to a single algo, but to analyze the problem and try different approaches
3. listen to their hints, pay attention to hints
4. don't give up, try hard, come up with the correct code for the end minute

## 06/27/22 Welcome

你不要放松 很需要你在这时候努力

Area 120
ERGs: Employee Resource Groups
Personal growth opportunities to keep you learning and growing:

- “Grow” classes and educational benefits
- Bungee or rotational programs
- 20% project

Fostering diversity and inclusion

process:

1. initial call with your recruiter and interview prep
2. 3 coding and 1 Googleyness and leadership interview
3. feedback review, match, and offer process: 2-3 weeks

Interview day-of logistics
be held over Google Meet
have a minimum of 15 minutes in between each round
Google’s Virtual Interviewing Platform (VIP) allows for real-time collaborative remote coding between the candidate and the interviewer, complete with formatting and syntax highlighting(no compiler)

Please do!

1. make sure you can be heard during virtual interview
2. turn on captions
3. utilize whiteboards, pen, and paper
4. be yourself

Please don’t!

1. wait until the last moment to test your technology
2. utilize outside technology (tablets, other tabs, your phone)

Googlyness

1. 30 mins long and does not
2. BQ: tell me about a time when…
    1. walk through your action, and show the result
3. Hypothetical
    1. imagine if…

Technical Interviews

1. each of the 3 lasts about 45 mins
2. expect 1-3 coding questions
3. there will be time for short introductions and closing questions

Skills

1. coding proficiency and quality
2. Data structures and algo
3. Problem solving and analytical skills
4. Communication and collaboration

What don’t see:

1. Brain teasers, puzzles, or trick questions
2. Systems design

Framework for a successful interview

1. clarify the question
    1. do yo understand?
        1. what are inputs and outputs
    2. is there additional information that’d be helpful
        1. numbers be negative? duplicate?
        2. are sorted?
        3. do I need to handle invalid inputs?
    3. why asking clarifying questions?
        1. demonstrate your communication skills
        2. save you a lot of time and avoid misunderstandings
2. design a solution
    1. Start with the first solution that comes to mind, then iterate
    2. Describe your algorithms and BIG-O
    3. Edge cases
    4. Tradeoffs to your solution
    5. THINK OUT LOUD
        1. Communicate with the interviewer the whole time
        2. Refine and improve solution collaboratively with your interviewer
        3. It’s OK to talk about ideas that you later realize don’t work
3. write your code
    1. Break solution into smaller parts using helper functions
    2. write full code (not pseudocode)
    3. verbalize: teach as you go
    4. listen for hints and suggestions
4. test your code
    1. don’t assume your code works
    2. walkthrough your code line by line. run at least 2 test cases to check
    3. If you realize ways to optimize your solution, talk about it
5. Common mistakes
    1. CLARIFY: Not understanding the question or prematurely optimizing
    2. DESIGN: Jumping into code
    3. CODE: Not writing real code
    4. TEST: Not talking about examples and not thinking of testing

Why google:

1. impact we can make

Interviews are isolated
