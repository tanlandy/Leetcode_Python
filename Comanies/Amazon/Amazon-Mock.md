## Intro
the intro has to be up to 2min

## Past Experience 
1. ownership, leadership: tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of reponsibilitiy. why was it important? what was the outcome -> solid example：得了什么任务，任务背景，我采取什么行动，最后结果是如何
   1. What data report look like(what you did speficily)
   2. Example of issue
   3. How to show the result to your teammates -> outcome!!!
2. tell me about a situation that required you to dig deep to get to the root cause? how did you know you were focusing on the right things? what was the outcome? would you have done anything differently? -> issue是什么，如何解决的
   1. 写一个todo list，然后和领导同事来对，确认是对的 -> real example
      1. -> two options: what choosed, why choosed that
   2. Other things that dive deep(challenges)
3. A time strongly disagree with your 
4. co-worker that on something you believe it's important to the business：分歧是什么，自己做了什么说服，最后结果
   1. S: 
   2. A: Data points used 
   3. R: 
5. Learn be curious: describe a time when you took on work outside of your comfort area

## Code
Implement a Map interface, allowing us to put a key-value pair, and retieve it with get(Key) to get lastest, and get(key, time) to get the value at the exact time it was inserted.

example:
put("fruit", "banana") // at time 1
put("fruit", "apple") // at time 2
put("fruit", "orange") // at time 3

get("fruit") => "orange"
get("fruit", "2") => apple

## Feedback:
不要不相关的话，最多5句话，1分钟就够了
一定要clarification

Question1: 
Introduction


What project/technology you like the most?

Code question -> 题做出来 + 沟通

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order. 

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc" 
Output: [0,6] 
Explanation: 
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc". 
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

Define own function, write solution

Test case, test the solution step by step
Time complexity

要求：
思路要清晰，做出来同时最佳方法，命名规范
不叫solution




BQ -> 把故事理顺，不要陷入细节，把要点讲清楚
5 projects in your Resume, pick one, if you could, how to make it in a better way? -> 项目了解程度，学习提升的能力，要有一个细节点

Assume you join, and need to learn new things? -> 找资料，带着方案问人
1. Search online for basic understanding, what is about, what can do
2. Go through documentation, by team or start tutorials
3. If still confuse about something ,cannot find solution online or document, ask collegue or manager for help if they are availble. 

What would you do when there's conflict with manager? —> 不要把自己意见藏起来，更加深入研究自己和manager之后再谈
1. make sure explain the opinion clearly to the manager, and understand their 
2. manager knows more than me, and be more , ask for his suggestion
3. Receive manager's feedback, it's good thing to have this talk
4. If he still insist on his, I think I'd better follow him.

Technical difficulty, one example? -> 看能不能坚持、尝试下来

-> Leadership principle

why amazon?
1. 产品好，服务稳定，创新aws平台，提供好的service
