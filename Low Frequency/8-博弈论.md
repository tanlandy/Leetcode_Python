# 博弈论

Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers! Player  always moves first, and both players always play optimally.The rules of the game are as follows:

Initially there are n towers.
Each tower is of height m.
The players move in alternating turns.
In each turn, a player can choose a tower of height x and reduce its height to y, where 1 < y < x  and y evenly divides x.
If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.

```py
def towerBreakers(n, m):
    """
    if height == 1, the game is immediately over
        => p.1 has no moves; p.2 wins
    if towers are divisible by 2, 
        => 2 mimics p.1's moves; p.2 wins
    otherwise, if towers is odd, p.1 can take the first tower down to 1,
    """
    if m == 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return 2
    return 1
```
