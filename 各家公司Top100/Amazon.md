## Code
Implement a Map interface, allowing us to put a key-value pair, and retieve it with get(Key) to get lastest, and get(key, time) to get the value at the exact time it was inserted.

example:
put("fruit", "banana") // at time 1
put("fruit", "apple") // at time 2
put("fruit", "orange") // at time 3

get("fruit") => "orange"
get("fruit", "2") => apple
